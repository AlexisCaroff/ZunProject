Warrior: Er, Chief? 

Priestess : Yes, what is it?

Warrior: Look er… It’s not that it hurts that much, but do you think you could lay off the whipping a bit? It’s hard to focus on the enemy in front while getting hit from behind…

Priestess :  Do you have a better way to snap you out of being bewitched?

Warrior: Well… the Völva at home had this brew to drink, to avoid getting caught by the forest huldras. I think there was mushrooms in it?

Priestess : I see. Well, sadly, I do not know how to make this pagan concoction. You’ll have to make do with my rituals to dispel lustful urges.

Warrior: The warrior grins.
A good fuck would probably help better. 


Priestess : During combat?

Warrior: Er…

Priestess :The priestess turns up her nose haughtily. 
Well, you may use the tent for your barbaric ways while we rest, at least.
