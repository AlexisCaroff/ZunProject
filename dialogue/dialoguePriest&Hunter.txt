Hunter: As the hunter brings a bowl of rations, the priestess takes it without a word.
The hunter’s eyes plead for her acknowledgment… but faced with irrefutable indifference, he finally dares to break the asphyxiating silence:
Mistress, I... I wish to apologize for my behaviour today. 

Priestess : The priestess doesn’t look at him, instead playing with her food. She doesn’t reply.

Hunter: I let a daemon slip by me and attack you. I failed in my duty to protect you.
And I… disrespected you... in front of the others. By not following your orders...

Priestess :...

Hunter: I will take whatever punishment you deem necessary. And... Once this mission is over, I will ask my order to send a suitable replacement.

Priestess : The priestess sets down the bowl and turns to him.
You will not.

Hunter: Mistress..?

Priestess : I alone decide when you are to be replaced. Do you understand?

Hunter: The hunter flushes and bows his head quickly.
Y..Yes, Mistress.


Priestess : This is not the first time you have presumed to know what is best for me. 
I have let your insolence slip so far, only because you have greater experience with the outside world.


Hunter: …

Priestess : But it seems you need a reminder of whom you belong to. 
I will decide your punishment later. 

Hunter:The hunter bows gratefully as the Priestess finally picks up her food and starts to eat.
 Yes Mistress. Thank you, Mistress.
