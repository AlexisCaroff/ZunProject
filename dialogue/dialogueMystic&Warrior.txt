Warrior: Plopping down near the mystic, the warrior greets the hermit with her usual bluntness, clapping him on the back with her broad hand.
You fight well for someone so skinny!
At home, our Völvas can speak to the Earth Mother’s brood and enlist their aid, but I’ve never seen any of them use spirits as weapons! Where did you learn this magic?

Mystic: The mystic coughs, trying to regain his breath.
Th..Thank you, Sam’at. The art of spirit bonding is taught in my clan. And they are not tools to use, but my friends. They aid me willingly.

Warrior: The warrior pokes at the slime resting on the Mystic’s shoulder, making it wobble.
Can they turn into any shape?

Mystic: It varies. If given enough energy, they can take a variety of shapes. Some can harden their shell to protect themselves. Others can produce miasma to weaken an enemy. 

Warrior: The Warrior grins.
What about more… entertaining shapes?

Mystic: Er.. Yes, I suppose?

Warrior: Do you ever use them for pleasure? 

Mystic: The mystic coughs again..
A spirit bond is sacred, and not used lightly.
But… if the spirits are willing, they can be communed with.

Warrior: The warrior laughs and claps the mystic’s back again.
Good to know!
