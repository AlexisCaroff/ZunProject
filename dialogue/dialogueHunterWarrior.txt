Warrior: The warrior seems restless, turning this way and that on her sleeping mat.
Finally, she sighs and stands up, and saunters over to the hunter who is busy meditating.

Warrior: She pokes his shoulder with her toe.
Hey, cutie. Wake up.

Hunter: The hunter exhales slowly, opening his weary eyes. He greets the hunter, without showing any irritation at her intrusion.
Yes? How may I be of assistance?


Warrior: My body is way too excited after all the weird ooze I’ve been drenched in.
I need a good jostle to be able to rest.

Hunter: The hunter blushes. 
Are all barbarians this shameless? He thinks to himself.
If you would like, I.. I can show you how to meditate? It helps suppress the urges. He blubbers out.

Warrior: The towering warrior grins at the blushing young hunter and goes to pick up her axe and shield.
Come on, grab your spear and show me some of those moves you use.

Hunter: The hunter blinks for a moment, before staggering to his feet. 
Thank the Light, she meant a spar.

Warrior: And if you’re good enough, maybe we’ll try another kind of exercise after! 
The warrior chuckles and beckons the red-faced hunter to attack.
