Hunter: After a quiet meal, the hunter props a pot of herbal infusion onto the fire.
Having served the others, he also brings the Mystic a cup.

Mystic: The mystic eyes the cup at first, but accepts it after a pause.

Hunter: Do not fear, Seeker. There would be no gain to us in poisoning you. 
I will drink from the cup first if you wish.


Mystic: The mystic looks at the hunter and laughs, before taking a sip.
I do not fear poison, young one. But I am unused to being treated well by Azun’biri.
Our two people have a long history of conflict. 

Hunter: The hunter frowns as he sits down next to the hermit.
I have heard that your clan fled to the desert to avoid the Empire. But my Masters in the order spoke of the Nal’eket with great respect. They said that in days of old, your people shared their wisdom with all who asked, even those of the faith.

Mystic: Yes.. but that was generations ago. before the Empire. And before your order chose to serve the Azun’biri.


Hunter: You know the history of my order? … What does Azun’biri mean?

Mystic: In my language, it is our name for the followers of the shining Goddess. It means “the blinded ones”.

Mystic: I see.. Would you tell me more about the history of our clans? 

Mystic: The mystic smiles.
 Perhaps later. We must rest now. Our task here is far from over.
